[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> **Problem Statement**

>> Investigate whether `random.random` really generates a random distribution of numbers.   

>> **Method**

>> Generated 1000 random numbers using numpy's `random.random`.
```python
import numpy as np
rand1000 = np.random.random(1000)
```

>> Created both the pmf and cdf of the number generated above using functions provided in Allen Downey's ThinkStats2 repository.
```python
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(rand1000)
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(rand1000)
```

>> **Solution**

>> For a truly random distribution, each number would have the same probability. The values shown on the pmf would all be equal; for a set of 1000 numbers, this would mean that each number would have a probability of 0.001. For a uniform distribution, with a sufficient sample size, the cdf would be approximate a line with a slope equal to 1.  

>> The pmf and cdf for 1000 random numbers generated by numpy's `random.random` are shown below. As shown, the values of the pmf are all 0.001 and the slope of the cdf is approximately 1.
